# React Photo Gallery

## Description

_Roughly 10 Pretty Distracted Hours_

This project is a React based webpage that holds a gallery of images from my memories with a like button and details much like the way many social media apps work. The challenge was creating an app that would be broken into components and setting up so that data can be sent between components.

To see the fully functional site, please download and install files from this repo.
